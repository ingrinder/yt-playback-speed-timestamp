# yt-playback-speed-timestamp
Small userscript to show a new YouTube time elapsed/duration when the playback speed is changed.

## How to use
The best way to use this script is with some sort of script injector. I use [Enhancer for YouTube](https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube), where you can paste in the `script.js` file contents and tick the "Automatically execute the script" checkbox.

This script may work in Greasemonkey and others but is untested in these.
